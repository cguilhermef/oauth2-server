'invalid_request'
     The request is missing a required parameter, includes an
     invalid parameter value, includes a parameter more than
     once, or is otherwise malformed.

'unauthorized_client'
     The client is not authorized to request an access token
     using this method.

'access_denied'
     The resource owner or authorization server denied the
     request.

'unsupported_response_type'
     The authorization server does not support obtaining an
     access token using this method.

'invalid_scope'
     The requested scope is invalid, unknown, or malformed.

'server_error'
         The authorization server encountered an unexpected
         condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.
         (This error code is needed because a 500 Internal Server
         Error HTTP status code cannot be returned to the client
         via an HTTP redirect.)

'temporarily_unavailable'
     The authorization server is currently unable to handle
     the request due to a temporary overloading or maintenance
     of the server.  (This error code is needed because a 503
     Service Unavailable HTTP status code cannot be returned
     to the client via an HTTP redirect.)


'error_description'
      OPTIONAL.  Human-readable ASCII [USASCII] text providing
      additional information, used to assist the client developer in
      understanding the error that occurred.
      Values for the "error_description" parameter MUST NOT include
      characters outside the set %x20-21 / %x23-5B / %x5D-7E.

'error_uri'
      OPTIONAL.  A URI identifying a human-readable web page with
      information about the error, used to provide the client
      developer with additional information about the error.
      Values for the "error_uri" parameter MUST conform to the
      URI-reference syntax and thus MUST NOT include characters
      outside the set %x21 / %x23-5B / %x5D-7E.
